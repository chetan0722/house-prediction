House Price Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts house prices based on various features such as location, number of rooms, total area, and other property attributes.
Overview
This project demonstrates a complete regression workflow:
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature engineering
Feature scaling
Model training and evaluation
Final prediction generation
The primary goal is to build a regression model capable of predicting house prices with good accuracy.
Technologies Used
Python
Jupyter Notebook
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib / Seaborn
Scikit-learn
Steps Performed
Loaded the dataset
Handled missing values and duplicates
Performed EDA using histograms, boxplots, correlation heatmap
Split dataset into training and test sets
Feature scaling using StandardScaler
Trained regression models (Linear Regression or others)
Evaluated performance using:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R² Score
Generated predictions for test data
Results
The model provides an estimated house price based on input features.
Performance metrics such as R² and MAE give insight into prediction accuracy.
